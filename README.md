# Automated Royalties for Creators

## Project Title
Automated Royalties for Creators

## Project Description
The Automated Royalties for Creators smart contract provides a decentralized solution for creative professionals to receive fair compensation for their work. Built on the Soroban platform using the Stellar blockchain, this contract enables transparent tracking of ownership, automated royalty distribution, and simplified licensing management.

This smart contract system allows creators to register their digital works, set customizable royalty percentages, and automatically receive payments when their content is used, licensed, or resold. The system is designed to empower artists, musicians, writers, and other creative professionals by ensuring they receive proper compensation for their work, eliminating the need for intermediaries, and providing transparent tracking of ownership and usage rights.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize how creators manage their intellectual property and receive compensation for their work. In traditional creative industries, artists often struggle to track usage of their work and collect rightful royalties. Intermediaries typically take significant cuts, and payment processes can be slow and opaque.

By leveraging blockchain technology through the Soroban platform, we aim to:
- Create a more equitable ecosystem for creators
- Streamline royalty collection and distribution
- Provide transparent tracking of content usage
- Eliminate unnecessary intermediaries
- Enable global access to creative works with fair compensation

This project serves as a bridge between the creative economy and decentralized finance, opening new opportunities for creators worldwide to maintain control over their work and receive proper recognition and compensation.
